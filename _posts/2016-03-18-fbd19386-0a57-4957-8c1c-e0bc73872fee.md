## [Presentation on Expansion Strategies][0]

****

* I worked on a team of 3 people, and had a part of every stage of the project.
* The client was Hope4Utah, a youth suicide prevention agency, who expressed to us the desire to expand into new states outside of Utah, but didn't know how to begin that process.
* We created 3 unique strategies for 3 different states. I worked primarily on the state of Montana, performing primary and secondary research, and then creating a strategy that Hope4Utah could use to begin expansion into that state.
* I designed the deliverable, a Power Point that we used both for presentation purposes and as a resource document for the client.
