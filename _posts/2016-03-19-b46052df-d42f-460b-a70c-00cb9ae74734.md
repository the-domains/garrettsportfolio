**What you will see in this portfolio:**

****

I am a competent team player, being a part of, and leading, many teams in many different types of tasks. 

****

* I have separated out the work here into two sections, the first being team projects and the second being individual.

****

I'm process driven; loving to get organized, plan, research, analyze, revise, then building a strategy and creating a deliverable.

****

* All of the projects here involve multiple parts of this process. In the individual project section, I've included multiple examples of this process for each project.

****

I try to be purposeful, deliberate, and economical with my time and efforts, ensuring that all my work is quality, created with clear understanding of how that piece functions within the larger strategy.
