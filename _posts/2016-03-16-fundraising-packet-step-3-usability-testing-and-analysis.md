**[Fundraising Packet Step \#3 - Usability Testing and Analysis][0]**

****

* After I created the content, made many revisions, one of the last steps was to get feedback from people in the target audience.
* I created a survey to go along with the fundraising document, which I sent to individuals I had selected.
* I used their feedback to make an analysis of the strengths and weaknesses of the document, and then made revisions accordingly.
