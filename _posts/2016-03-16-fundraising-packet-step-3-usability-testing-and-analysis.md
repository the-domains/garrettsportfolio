**[Fundraising Packet Step \#3 - Usability Testing and Analysis][0]**

****

* After I created the content and made revisions, one of the last steps was to get feedback from the target audience.
* I created a survey to go along with the fundraising document, which I sent selected individuals.
* I used their feedback to make an analysis of the strengths and weaknesses of the document, and then revised the document accordingly.
