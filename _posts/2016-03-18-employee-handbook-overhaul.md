Employee Handbook Overhaul 

* I was the project manager of a team of 5 people
* The client was Big Monocle, a graphic design firm, whose**CEO expressed to me a need to edit the employee handbook for the company.**
* **After working with the client, it was determined that a complete overhaul of the handbook was necessary, including macro- and micro-edits.**
* **As a team, we devised and executed a strategy to completely revise the handbook, focusing on maintaining the voice and culture of the company, ensuring high usability, removing redundancy, and macro- and micro-editing for complete professionalism.**
