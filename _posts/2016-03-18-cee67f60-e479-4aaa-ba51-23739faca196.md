## Integrated Marketing Plan

****

* I worked with a 5-person team, where my role was in research and creation of the action plan, budget estimates, and evaluation plan.

****

* The client was TKO Cancer Foundation, a brand new non-profit organization 
* Their business model was based on hosting charity events, and they were in need of a marketing plan.

****

* As a team, we decided to create a menu of possible strategies that the client could use. 

****

* With each strategy we formed specific objectives, tactics, budget estimations, and methods for evaluation of effectiveness, so that the client could choose which options might work best for them, and have a road map for implementation.
