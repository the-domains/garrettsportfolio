# Who I Am

I am a graduate from Westminster College in Salt Lake City, Utah, with a Masters in Strategic Communication. I grew up with a serious hunger for trying to understand problems, make analyses, and form strategies. I was the kind of kid who'd rather be the coach of the soccer team than the star player. 

But I don't shy away from spotlight. I've spent my life in pursuit of relentless creativity, which has taken me to variety of projects and a breadth of experiences, often putting myself and my work front and center for all the world to see.

I found a home in Strategic Communications because it allows me to combine my analytical and creative sides as I manage teams, work through tasks, and solve problems efficiently and creatively.

After you've looked through my portfolio, feel free to contact me, I'd love to hear from you. Also, you can take a look at [my full resume here.][0]
