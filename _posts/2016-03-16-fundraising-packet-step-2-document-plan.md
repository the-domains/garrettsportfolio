**[Fundraising Packet Step \#2 - Document Plan][0]**

* Including all my research and a situation analysis, I created a detailed plan for the fundraising document.
* **This plan included rhetorical design, strategic imperatives, design concepts, and a content outline.**
* Having this framework allowed me to create the content in exact accordance with the demands and strategies dictated by the research.
