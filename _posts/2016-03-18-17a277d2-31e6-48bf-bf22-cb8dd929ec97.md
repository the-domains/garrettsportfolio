## [Employee Handbook Overhaul][0]

****

* I was project manager with a team of 5 people.
* Big Monocle, the client, is a graphic design firm, whose CEO expressed a need to me for an edit of their employee handbook
* I worked with the CEO to identify exactly what problems the handbook had, and what value she hoped our team could add to it. 
* ****As a team, we devised and executed a strategy to completely revise the handbook, focusing on maintaining the voice and culture of the company, ensuring high usability, removing redundancy, and macro- and micro-editing for complete professionalism.
