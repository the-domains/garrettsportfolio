## [Communications Workbook][0]

* I was in charge of the entire research phase for this project, as well as creation of some of the content.
* Our client was the South Salt Lake City, specifically their council of Jobs and Economic Development (JEDI).
* The client was in need of a tool that the members of that council could utilize to better examine and understand the population which they serve.
* As a team, we devised a strategy of creation a short workbook, with information, examples, and activities, to be read and filled out by the members of the JEDI committee.
* I performed the bulk of the research and content creation, including the creating of the activity sections of the workbook, always through a rhetorical lens, keeping in mind the needs of the client.
