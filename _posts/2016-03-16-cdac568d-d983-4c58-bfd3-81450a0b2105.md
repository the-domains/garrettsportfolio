To me, the key to creating a quality product or strategy is a quality investment in process: Find a problem, do the research, make a plan, then create, revise, execute and evaluate. And repeat.

Each of the following projects are for the same client, Deep Love Opera, spanning almost two years of work within that process. Each of the following 3 projects represent a different kind of problem, and the solution I provided. 

Additionally, for each project in this section, I included examples of the steps I took and the process I invested in.
