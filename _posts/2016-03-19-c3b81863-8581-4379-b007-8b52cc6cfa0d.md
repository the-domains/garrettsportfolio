## What Is Strategic Communication?

****

* A catch-all of multiple fields such as integrated marketing, organizational communication, and professional writing, with a unique focus on the process by which a particular communication problem is identified, analyzed, and then solved through careful planning and execution, in both individual and team settings.

> Strategic communication extends well beyond its practical application in various fields of practice... It is a distinct approach focusing on the process of communication which offers complementary insights.  -Routledge Handbook of Strategic Communication
